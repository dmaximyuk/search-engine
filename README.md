# Foreword
What is this template for? Everything is simply banal. There are a lot of templates on the github where there is a lot of superfluous and often deleted garbage, as well as a strange nesting of files to the point of madness. This template offers a fast assembler, complete with typescript and sass, minimal garbage and an intuitive login.
